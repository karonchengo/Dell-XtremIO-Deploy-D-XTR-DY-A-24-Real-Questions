<h1>Dell XtremIO Deploy Assessment and Achievement</h1>

<p>This assessment focuses on the knowledge involved in implementing XtremIO storage systems in heterogeneous virtualized open systems environments. This includes cluster installation and initial configuration, implementing and configuring host access to storage, implementing local replication, performance monitoring and optimization, and basic troubleshooting. This achievement validates the knowledge to install and implement solutions using XtremIO and X2 systems. The assessment is supported by a core curriculum describing the critical components of the XtremIO and X2 systems, their features, and implementing the solutions in customer environments.</p>
